Problem Type	Recommended N	Recommended T	Special Considerations

Low-dimensional (<10D)	20-30	100-500	Focus on exploitation, reduce exploration components
Medium-dimensional (10-100D)	30-50	500-1000	Balance exploration and exploitation
High-dimensional (>100D)	50-100	1000-5000	Emphasize exploration, increase population diversity
Multimodal problems	50-100	1000-2000	Increase population size and exploration components
Unimodal problems	20-50	500-1000	Focus on exploitation, reduce population size
Constrained optimization	30-50	1000-2000	May require modification of boundary handling
