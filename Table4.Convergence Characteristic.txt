Convergence Stage	Main Behavior	Parameter Changes	Goal

Early stage (t/T<0.3)	Strong exploration	High probability of B>0.5, larger CF	Explore the search space widely
Middle stage (0.3≤t/T<0.7)	Balance exploration and exploitation	Fluctuating B, moderate CF	Balance global and local search
Late stage (t/T≥0.7)	Strong exploitation	High probability of B≤0.5, smaller CF	Fine search near the optimal solution
